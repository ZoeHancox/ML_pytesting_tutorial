        "# Introduction to PyTesting\n",
        "\n",
        "When writing machine learning code in Python, there are several testing frameworks available that can be used to ensure the quality, behaviour and correctness of your code. Using a testing framework for your ML code promotes code quality, reliability, and maintainability. It allows you to catch bugs early, reduce errors, and have confidence in the performance of your machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of testing code\n",
        "\n",
        "Validation: Testing frameworks enable you to validate the correctness of your machine learning models and algorithms. By writing tests, you can verify that your code behaves as expected and produces the desired results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regression Testing: Machine learning code often evolves over time, and changes made to the codebase can introduce new bugs or break existing functionality. Testing frameworks help in implementing regression testing, allowing you to detect and fix issues when modifying your ML code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Documentation: Writing tests alongside your code provides executable documentation that demonstrates how your code should be used and the expected outputs. This helps other developers understand and utilize your ML code more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuous Integration: Testing frameworks are commonly used in continuous integration (CI) pipelines to automatically run tests on code changes. CI ensures that your ML code remains functional and reliable as you develop new features or make modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Maintainability: Tests act as a safety net, making it easier to refactor or modify your code with confidence. They ensure that the changes you make do not introduce unexpected errors or regressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Collaboration: Testing frameworks make it easier for multiple developers to collaborate on ML projects. By running tests, everyone can quickly verify that their changes have not broken existing functionality.\n",

        "Some popular testing frameworks in Python include:\n",
        "\n",
        "__unittest:__ This is a built-in testing framework in Python's standard library. It provides a set of tools for constructing and running tests. unittest is widely used and offers a comprehensive testing solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "__pytest:__ It is a third-party testing framework that provides a more concise and flexible approach to writing tests compared to unittest. pytest supports advanced features such as fixtures, parameterized testing, and test discovery, making it popular among developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "__doctest:__ This framework allows you to write tests within the documentation strings (docstrings) of your functions, making it easier to keep tests and code documentation in sync. doctest is lightweight and useful for simple test cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "__nose:__ It is a test discovery and execution framework that extends unittest. nose automatically discovers test cases and provides additional plugins and features for testing Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this session we will be using __PyTest__ to write and run our tests."
